# hardened-chromium

Chromium allows disabling features via command line switches.  Rather
than compile a custom version of Chromium, let's disable a bunch of
things when launching it.

# Usage
See [bin/hardened-chromium](./bin/hardened-chromium) for the simple
shell-based launcher you can throw in your `$PATH`.
